A Twin 8.8" touchscreen display Compute Module 4 power beast.

After the BlackRPI Clive & Sharpikeebo, now time to work on more adrenalin. A Twin 8.8" touchscreen display Compute Module 4 power beast
So this project is started. 2 displays (one is touchscreen so we can use it as an intelligent pointing pad). A SSD M.2 hard drive and a true real cherry MX keys keyboard. We should also be able to add a 4G chip for cellular internet.
